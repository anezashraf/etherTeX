HOW TO INSTALL etherTeX
=======================

in the same directory as the files provided by etherTeX you should put (or link):
py_etherpad.py from https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite .

etherTeX also expects to find pdf.js into its directory.


You need to edit pdfjs.py:
* edit the path to your pdflatex version
* edit the etherpad api line

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
