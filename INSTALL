HOW TO INSTALL etherTeX
=======================

in the same directory as the files provided by etherTeX you should put (or link):
py_etherpad.py from https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite .

Also compatibility.js, viewer.css, viewer.js from pdf.js should be found in the
same directory. etherTeX also expects to find the rest of pdf.js at ../pdf.js/

You need to edit pdfjs.py:
* edit the path to your pdflatex version
* edit the etherpad api line

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
